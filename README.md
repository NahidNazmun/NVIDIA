This repository has been created for NVIDIA JETSON NANO certification. The goal of this project is to creat a gesture recognition system which we will be able to integrate in small robots to perform Human Robot Interaction smoothly.
# Motivation
Body language and gestures, in particular, say a lot about you. A hand gesture is whenever you move your hand or head to express or emphasize an idea. And this is an important part of your overall body language. In a study by researchers from the University of Rome point out 4 main reasons hand gestures are important:​

Hand gestures can help you describe what you’re talking about, both literally (e.g., when you talk about drawing a circle, you can motion a circle with your hand) and metaphorically (e.g., you could motion a circle with your hand to say “everybody”)​

Hand gestures can help you point to people and things in your surroundings (e.g., pointing at an object while you say “look at that”)​

Hand gestures can help you add emphasis and structure when you talk (e.g., showing numbers when you count, “1, 2, 3…”)​

Hand gestures give clues about your emotional state. These gestures are not always connected to what you’re saying (e.g., are you confident?, are you lying?, are you anxious?)​

What the study also found is that hand gesture are extremely RELIABLE.​
